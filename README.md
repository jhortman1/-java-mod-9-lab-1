Instructions
Using the same pattern we used to apply conditional formatting to the sender's avatar, apply conditional formatting to the sender's actual message, so that messages from a user who's currently online are bolded and messages from a user who is currently offline are using a lighter font weight.

Hints:

Font weights can be controlled using the following Bootstrap classes: fw-bold and fw-light
There are several other values you could use, but those 2 are sufficient to support our use case
Your application display should look like this:

Font Weights

Here is our sender message component after this change:

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-1 p-3">
      <span
        class="badge"
        [ngClass]="message.sender.isOnline ? 'bg-primary' : 'bg-secondary'"
      >
        {{message.sender.firstName[0]}}</span
      >
    </div>
    <div class="col-8 p-3 border rounded-5">
      <span [ngClass]="message.sender.isOnline ? 'fw-bold' : 'fw-light'">
        {{message.text}}</span
      >
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
